I have started the Python Quick Start Guide by Robert Oliver. I've seen a few other tutorials or templates to get started but nothing got me started faster than this book.
Here are my first few practice codes from the first chapter of the book. Nothing crazy, complicated, or really at all intersting. But I've started. 
The end of the chapter starts the development of a coffee shop simulator. Asking for the users name, the name of their new coffee shop and how much they will charge for a cup of coffee. 
I will upload that as well and maybe someone will follow along and see the progress as I work my may through the book. Check back for code updates. 

I'm still obviously new to Github so I will be figuring out this platform as well. Lets see where this goes.
